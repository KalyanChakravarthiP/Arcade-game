# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project:
=======================================
The main objective of this game is get player from the grass over the road and into the water. The challenge is to avoid the bugs that travel the road. While developing logic for the player to reach the water with out touch bugs, I enjoyed a lot.

## Instructions

Use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/15/view) for self-checking your submission.

Download Starter code from (https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game) and modify it for game completion.

Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like `Player` and `Enemy`) or class prototype functions such as `Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions`. Also make sure that the keyword `this` is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon.

Your **README.md** file should be updated with instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.


For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
